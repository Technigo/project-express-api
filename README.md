# Project Express API

This weeks project was to build an API to meet at least the criterias listed here:
✓ At least two routes 
✓ A minimum of one endpoint to return a collection of results (array of elements).
✓ A minimum of one endpoint to return a single result (single element).
✓ Your API should be [RESTful]

## The problem

I focused mainly on the API and has not built a frontend to handle the API yet. 
I had a meeting with my codementor and got guidance along the way on how to set up the API from scratch. It felt fun and I liked this week even though backend feels tricky now this first week. 
I would try to build a frontend for this API if I had more time :D
