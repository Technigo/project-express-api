# Express API Project

This is my first API with several endpoints. It is connected to json file of Netflix movie database. This project was done in the framework of Technigo bootcamp for front-end development. Both types of path option and query search has been implemented.

endpoints:
root: list of endpoints
/movies : list of movies in th library
/movies_dir : query for director (/movies_dir?director=name)
/movies/selection : query for director and release year (/movies/selection?director=name&release_year=YYYY)
/movies/type : list of movies types
