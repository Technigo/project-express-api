# Express API Project

This was a project I did while attending the Technigo frontend bootcamp. The assignment was to get an introduction to backend and creating an API using Express. The requirements was to create at least a couple of RESTful endpoints which return either an array of data, or a single item.


## The problem

I had some problems having returning any data at all and couldn´t find any bugs in my code. After a while I tried to use another port and it started working. Maybe something unexpected happend to my server/terminal.

Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
