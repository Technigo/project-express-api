# Build an API using Express - Overview
Project done as a part of Technigo bootcamp.

This week's project is to start your backend journey by creating an API using Express. Your API should have at least a couple of RESTful endpoints which return either an array of data, or a single item.

<!-- description -->



Learning Objectives:
- How to build an API in Node using Express
- How to create routes in Express
- Practice data manipulation in JavaScript - selecting, filtering, and limiting arrays

## Approach


## Core Tech
<!-- - CSS
- API
- React
- React Hooks
- JSX -->



## Requirements Completed
ðŸ”µ  Blue Level
<!-- - Your API should be deployed to Heroku or similar hosting service. -->
- Your API should have at least 2 routes. Try to push yourself to do more, though!
- A minimum of one endpoint to return a **collection** of results (array of elements)
<!-- - A minimum of one endpoint to return a **single** result (single element). -->
- Your API should be [RESTful](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/01/understanding-using-rest-api/)

ðŸ”´  Red Level (Intermediary Goals)
<!-- - On routes which return a single item, handle when the item doesn't exist and return some useful data in the response. -->
- Accept filters via query parameters to filter the data you return from endpoints which return an array of data.
<!-- - Create some empty/dummy endpoints which could contain more complex operations in the future.  Find good names for them (think back to the labs) -->


âš«  Black Level (Advanced Goals)
<!-- - Build a frontend which uses your API in some way to show the data in a nice way (use the [react-starter](https://github.com/Technigo/react-starter) template to get up and running fast). -->
<!-- - If your dataset is large, try implementing 'pages' using `.slice()` to return only a selection of results from the array. You could then use a query parameter to allow the client to ask for the next 'page'. -->
<!-- - Create useful documentation for your endpoints. What's a good way to present this documentation?  What if it changes in the future?  Are there any npm packages that could help with this? -->
