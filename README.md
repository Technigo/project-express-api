# Express API Project

Project to learn build RESTful API's.
I found <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/zynicide/wine-reviews">this</a> JSON based on wine reviews on <a href="https://www.winemag.com/">https://www.winemag.com/</a>, which I decided to use. It contained a huge amount of data, some of which key-values I thought could be fun to play around with, like sorting the top rated and most expensive ones.

## The problem

For this project I used express in Node.js. To list my endpoints I used a package called express-list-endpoints.
