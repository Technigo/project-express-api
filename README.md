# Express API Project

Simple project to dwelve into the business of Restful APIs.

## The problem

This was pretty fun, and gave a cool insight into how the backend responds to requests. We've done it millions of times on various websites, but first time seeing the other side of it.

Had to make sure the proper use of find, filter etc was applied to path and query params respectively as they are intended for different outcomes. I think this project really highlighted in a good way how they're used in their own proper manner.
