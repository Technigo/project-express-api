# Express API Project

Project making my first backend API with Express and RESTful endpoints.

## The problem

Started by using a local API.json with information about books. Then continued on to filter some of the information with query and params for different routes such as Id, Author, Title etc.

Also did a simple frontend for the API.

If I had more time I would've liked doing prettier frontend for the API and maybe also some pagination for the information.

API documentation can be found in the root of the API.
