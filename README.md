# Project Express API

this week we chose a json who we would like to use as our basedata for out API

## The problem

looked at the data to figure out what could be interesting for the user to fetch.
after I made a bunch of routes, I made one query filter who could also be used to filter the data as well.
then i looked into how to document the api, and write that to a file who would be updated if the file changed to make sure the api always is updated.
