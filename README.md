# Project Express API

The goal was to create a basic Express.js server for an API, providing endpoints for data retrieval, filtering, listing, and dynamically listing all routes.

## The problem

I created an Express.js server with dynamic route listing. Tried to get express-list-endpoints library to work. Not sure it meets the specified criteria.
