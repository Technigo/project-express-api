# Express API Project
This weeks project was to start with backend and to build an API using Express. It should have at least two endpoints and be RESTful.

## The problem
It was fun to start with backend and my first feeling is good. Will be fun to learn more!

Endpoints I've used:

Root: /
Songs: /songs (shows the whole data)
Single song: /songs/id (sorts on specific sonf sorted by id)
Genre: /genre (sorts on what genre you type after /genre)

Tech I've used this week:
- JS
- Node.js
- Express
