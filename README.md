# Express API Project

A backend project where I've built my own API using Node.js and Express ü§ìüå∑üé∫‚òÑÔ∏è

## The problem

Creating my very first API through Heroku using Top 50 songs. Used params and queries to be able to sort through the retrieved data. The first response is the list with all of the songs and their details. Here you're able to use queries to sort by popularity high or low and also filter on genres. Examples below. The genre filter will include country pop if you search for just pop to make it more inclusive.

There's a preliminary frontend to look at where I've used this API with React.js:
