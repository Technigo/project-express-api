# Express API Project

The focus for this weeks project is to start learning backend by creating our very first API using Express. 

## The problem/How I solved it
The task is to create an API that should have at least a couple of RESTful endpoints, which returns either an array of data or a single item. Since we're not using databases yet, we got a set of hard-coded data stored as a JSON files in the project. The API endpoints created use this file along with array methods such as .find(), .filter(), and .slice() to select, filter, or limit the items returned in the responses.
