# Express API Project
 This week's project was to create our own first API.

## The problem

The API is built in Node using Express. I have created several endpoints for my API that have path params and query params. The set of data I use is hard-coded as a JSON file. I have used the .slice() method to return the results from an array in pages. The project is deployed in Heroku.
