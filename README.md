# Express API Project

A project which aim was to start learning backend by creating an API in Node using Express. 

## The problem

The aim of the project was to start learning backend by creating an API in Node using Express. As a start I created different routes in Express. I then practiced how to manipulate the data in JavaScript by using filter, slice, includes and more. I also practiced on how to set up conditionals to catch errors. To deploy my server I used Heroku.
