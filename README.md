# Project Express API

This weeks project was to create an API using Express. The API were to have at least a couple of RESTful endpoints which return either an array of data or a single item.

## The problem

This weeks code sessions were a good help. I followed the example and added some query param filtering.

If I had more time, I would have tried out building a frontend part.
