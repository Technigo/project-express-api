# Express API Project

First backend project creating an API using Express. The API has a few of RESTful endpoints which return either an array of data, or a single item.

## The problem

Using a hard-coded set of data, stored as a JSON file in the project. The API endpoints created uses this file along with array methods such as .find() and .filter() to select and filter the items returned in the responses.
