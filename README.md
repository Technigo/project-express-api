# Express API Project

The assignment for week 17 of the TECHNIGO Boot Camp was to create a couple of RESTful endpoints which return either an array of data, or a single item. This was our very first brief dedicated to backend.

## The problem

We started out with some initial hard-coded data, stored as JSON files. I choose to work with an API listing 500 book reviews.

The minimum requirements were to create at least 2 routes using Express in Node, with the API being RESTful. One of the endpoints had to return a collection of results, and one of the endpoints a single result.

My first endpoint lists an array of elements being all books, and also accepts a filter via query parameters to generate books specified by author. My second endpoint returns a single element generated by the unique book id.

Next step will be to expand the routes and include more endpoints, and to build a frontend to go along with the project.
