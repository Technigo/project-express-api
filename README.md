# Project Express API
This week's project was to create an API using Express including RESTful endpoints. I chose to do a book library and use the data from the included json file.

## The problem
I started with re-watching the lesson where Matilda showed how to create an API. First I did a few test endpoints and used console log to see if I understood it correctly and if it worked. Afterwards I continued to work gradually by fetching data for one endpoint at a time. I did a few different versions of the language filter to see which one was the most user friendly. I mainly watched the lesson on disco which was very helpful. I also used google and chatgbt when I couldn't figure out any occouring error's myself. If I would have more time I would continue with the stretch goals and create more endpoints and it would've been fun to work on the frontend too.
