# Project Express API

## **🔵 Blue Level (Minimum Requirements)**

- Your API should have at least 2 routes. Try to push yourself to do more, though!
- A minimum of one endpoint to return a **collection** of results (array of elements)
- A minimum of one endpoint to return a **single** result (single element).
- Your API should be [RESTful](https://www.notion.so/REST-API-4f41f34c6938418fa5193d286da491d9)

💡 Make sure you've committed and pushed a version of your project before starting with the intermediary and advanced goals.

## **🔴 Red Level (Intermediary Goals)**

- On routes which return a single item, handle when the item doesn't exist and return some useful data in the response.
- Accept filters via query parameters to filter the data you return from endpoints which return an array of data.
- Create some empty/dummy endpoints which could contain more complex operations in the future. Find good names for them (think back to the labs)

## **⚫ Black Level (Advanced Goals)**

- Build a frontend which uses your API in some way to show the data in a nice way (use the [react-starter](https://github.com/Technigo/react-starter) template to get up and running fast).
- If your dataset is large, try implementing 'pages' using `.slice()` to return only a selection of results from the array. You could then use a query parameter to allow the client to ask for the next 'page'.
- Create useful documentation for your endpoints. What's a good way to present this documentation? What if it changes in the future? Are there any npm packages that could help with this?
