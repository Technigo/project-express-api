# Project Express API

The aim for this week's project is to start learning the basic of backend. Main focus is building our own API

## The problem

This week was a pretty straightforward project, where we learned the basics of express api, and how to connect and route. 
I attended the live sessions, and did codealong. 

If I had more time, I would try to create the frontend part for the project
