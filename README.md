# Project Express API

This week's project was to for the first time work with backend. The task was to create an API using Express. The API should have at least a couple of RESTful endpoints which should return either an array of data or a single item.

## The problem

I started watching and reading the material for the week as usual and then did the video code-along with Damien. Then I choose one of the data sets provided in the repo and started creating suitable endpoint paths for my API. I managed to make endpoints for both a param and query but I struggled to make one that would filter by the number of the rating of a book, so if you would follow the path .../books?rating=4 it would show you all books with a rating of 4 or higher. I tried searching for a solution, asked my team mates and asked on our Technigo Stack Overflow but I haven't found a solution yet. If I have time I will try more. 

I was able to do some stretch goals this week and made a site that uses the data from my API, it was good to repeat how to code a fetch request on a simple site.
