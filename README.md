# Express API Project

This project was part of Technigo Bootcamp, and the assignment this week was to build an API with Express from a set datafile. This was our first project working in the backend, and the requirements included creating a few routes both for a collection of results and a specific result.

## The problem

I am a big Netflix fan so I decided to use the data file for Netflix data. I found the assignment suprisingly easy to do and manage to do all the basic requirements in day 1 and was then able to create a front end to try and use my API to display it.

I created 4 endpoints, including one with all TV-shows, one for a specific show and then I also did one that gives a random show from the data file. I also added some queries so that one can filter on country and year.

The endpoint to generate a random response triggered an idea to build a frontend which allows the user who want some ideas of what to watch to press a button to recive a random show.
