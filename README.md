# Project Express API

The goal for this weeks project was to create an API with Express. The project has a couple of endpoints, all using GET method, to get arrays of data or a single item. 

## The problem

This was the first time I used Express and creating my own API. I enjoyed better understanding the structure of APIs as well as getting into the RESTfulness mindset. When I have more time I would love to create a frontend with documentation to my API as well as using queries in combination with params.
