# Project Express API

The task was to build an own API using Express.js and data from a json-file.

## The problem

Since I'm not used to working backend it felt a bit unusual to not be able to see the changes directly, so I was first not sure if I was completely wrong. But I think it turned out good, and I even used a different json-file than the one provided. The one I used was a database over strength exercises, which is my biggest interest and I am excited to see how I can use this in the future.
