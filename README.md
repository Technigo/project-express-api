# Express API Project

This is a project within the Technigo fronten developer boot camp.
The objective was to start exploring backend by creating an API using Express. The API should have at least a couple of RESTful endpoints which return either an array of data, or a single item.

## The problem

The problem to solve was to create several endpoints from local stored data. I choose the music data from Spotify and tried to make some variations, using params and querys. I used find and filter methods, and slice to divide the data into several pages. I alsa added a 404 error page but not sure I gor that to work. If I had more time I would investigate the error page, and do more filtering with several queries.
