# Project Express API

For this weeks project we're using Express.js to create an API.

## The problem

I don't know if I've missunderstood the assignment or if it's really simple this week.
Half of it was done out of the box - most of the rest was just copy paste from this weeks materials.

I installed Express List Endpoints and added the route method, and played around a bit with filters.

Instead of creating a front though, I think I'll will move on to next weeks project...

### Requirements

- Your API should have at least 3 routes. Try to push yourself to do more, though!
  - The endpoint "/" should return documentation of your API using e.g. [Express List Endpoints](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-list-endpoints)
  - A minimum of one endpoint to return a **collection** of results (array of elements).
  - A minimum of one endpoint to return a **single** result (single element).
- Your API should be [RESTful](https://www.notion.so/23473abe980e40aaa932914751055d22?pvs=21).
