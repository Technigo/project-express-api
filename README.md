# Project Express API
The purpose of this project was to build a RESTful API in Node using Express, including:
- A minimum of one endpoint to return an array of elements
- A minimum of one endpoint to return a single element
- Filtering using query parameters
- On routes which return a single item, handle when the item doesn't exist

Personal stretch goals that were achieved:
- Paginated results with queries for page number and results per page
- Documentation with OpenAPI and Swagger tooling
