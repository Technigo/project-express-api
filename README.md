# Express API Project

This weeks assignment was to create a REST api using express and then publish the api using heroku.

## The problem

I started out selecting the data I wanted to use and put it in a json-file in the project. Then i started out with the first endpoint which returns all the albums. Then I created new endpoints. I finished by creating a frontend page which is partly created to show the data in "use", and also as a documentation.
