# Express API Project

This was the first project I made with Node.js and Express.

## The problem

This project was just to start working with the basics of Node and Express. I used data from Netflix and build an API based on it. I created a couple of paths to target different things from the data.

## View it live

I used Heroku to deploy it, here's the link:

I also made a simple front end part to try it out, it is deployed here:
