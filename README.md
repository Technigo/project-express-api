# Project Express API

A small fullstack project accessing data about Nobel Laureates via an API created using Express. 

## The problem

I started bulding the backend using Express. I decided to use other data than the one already provided to learn how to convert a CSV to JSON. I created placeholders for future endpoints and also query params. 

For the frontend I wanted to create asomerhign very simple to display the data from the live server. I used styled components for styling and react routes to access different endpoints.

If I had more time I would clean up the backend and create more logical endpoints to fit the prupose of the frontend and I would add more filters to the frontend for the user to find more specific data. 

PROBLEM: I'm not able to get the deployment on netlify to work and I don't know how to solve it.
