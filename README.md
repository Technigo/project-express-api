# Express API Project

This week's project was to start our backend journey by creating an API using Express. My API have some RESTful endpoints which returns both array's of data, and a single item.

## The problem

For this project we got some hard-coded data, stored as a JSON file in our project. I have used filter() as array method to return my API endpoints. This was the first time creating backend within this bootcamp and it turned out very fun. I have created some routes and I've made my API RESTful.
