# Express API Project

The project shows all Taylor Swift songs in a Json file using express.

## The problem

The endpoints in the api are:
/ All the endpints in the api
/songs displays a collection of all songs in the api
/songs/index/:index shows a specific song based on the index in the URL
/songs/title/:title shows a specific song based on the name in the URL
/songs/album?album=anyAlbum shows all song from a specific album
/songs/year?year=anyYear shows all songs from a specific year
