# Express API Project

My first API built using Node js and Express.

## Features

- The API has 2 routes.
- The first endpoint returns an array of elements (all seasons and it's data) = "/seasons"
- The second endpoint returns a single element (a specific season and it's data) = "/season:season" example: "/season/1"
