# Express API Project

This project was to create my own API. I chose to make it about the 500 popular books with different endpoints, params and queries. I also created a frontend with the API.

## The problem

The project went quite smoothly, no big issues. So I hade some time to also create a frontend. Wanted to cement my React knowledge and it was fun creating one with my own API. 

If I would have had more time I would have done an API documentation, maybe some more endpoints and made the frontend a little nicer with more functions.
