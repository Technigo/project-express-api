## Express API Project

This week project's was an introduction to backend by creating our first RESTful API using Express.

## Goals

- The API should have at least 2 routes
- One endpoint to return a collection of results (array elements)
- A minimum of one endpoint to return a single result

## What I learned

- How to build an API in Node using Express
- How to create routes in Express
- Practice data manipulation in JavaScript - selecting, filtering, and limiting arrays

## How I built it

I used Postman to visualize the requests sent and the dependency listEndPoints to show the user the endpoints available. I created the following queries:

- all books
- books by author
- books by id
- books by title

If I had more time I would have built a couple more endpoints and also created the frontend to see the endpoints implemented and ready to use.
