# Project Express API

This project is a RESTful API built with Express.js that uses data from a JSON file of popular songs. It allows users to fetch a list of songs, get details for a specific song, and filter songs by various criteria such as genre, artist, BPM, and popularity.

## The problem

I planned the project by deciding which endpoints I needed and how to structure the data to handle route logic. I used Express List Endpoints to generate automatic documentation, making it easy to navigate and test the API. I tested using Chrome to verify that each endpoint returned the correct data and returned meaningful error messages for invalid inputs.

If I had more time I would add more filtering capabilities, such as filtering by energy or danceability. I would also build a frontend interface and implement pagination to better organize and display the data.
