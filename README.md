# Express API Project

This weeks assigment was to create my first backend. The focus was to understand Routes and path params.

## The problem

I started by watching content on what backend is and after I utilized the live sessions to understand how make my routing. I decided on a dataset to go with and then created a couple routes that I or any front end now can reach and showcase.

If I had more time I would have created a front end of my backend.
