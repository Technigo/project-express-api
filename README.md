# Project Express API

The project for this week was to create a RESTful API using Express. The API needed to have at least two endpoints - one that would return an array of data, and one that was capable of returning a specific/single item. There was also the option to accept filters via query parameters which I included. 

## The Problem
I started by planning how and what I would include in the project from the requirements and stretch goals. I then moved onto reviewing the existing examples and codealong code to understand the level of complexity for the data set that would be used for the API. Then, I identified the data I wanted to use - my own reading data from Story Graph. I downloaded my data, cleaned up the data set to make it more useable. When I began coding I wrote one endpoint at a time, testing it before moving to the next. Once my API was functioning, I deployed the backend, and began working on the frontend. I chose to use the frontend as a way to share the API documentation, and example data from different query values. 

If I had more time, I would work on paginating the data so that it doesn't return more than 50 results at a time. I would also troubleshoot the issue with the background on the frontend. The background gets distorted when the datasets are long.
