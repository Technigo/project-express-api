# Project Express API

This weeks project was to create an Express backend API with at least three RESTful endpoints, returning arrays or single items using hard-coded JSON data and array methods. The API was supposed to be RESTful and there should be API-documentation at the "/"-endpoint.

## The problem

I started reading the documentation for the express-list-endpoints and how to implement that. Once it was implemented, I started building the first tracks-endpoint. Then the Id-endpoint and further on I added filter-functionalities with the help of query-params to the tracks-endpoint.
