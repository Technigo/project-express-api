# Express API Project

I used the top 100 streamed songs of all time on Spotify. The source of the data was Kaggle.com, which in turn retrieved it from http://organizeyourmusic.playlistmachinery.com/.
Replace this readme with your own information about your project.

Start by briefly describing the assignment in a sentence or two. Keep it short and to the point.

## The problem

Error handling when using query parameters
Missed a backslash on tracks
Missing: Pagination
Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?

## View it live

Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.

## Blue requirements:

- Your API should have at least 2 routes. Try to push yourself to do more, though!
- A minimum of one endpoint to return a **collection** of results (array of elements) -> tracks with high danceability
- A minimum of one endpoint to return a **single** result (single element).
- Your API should be [RESTful](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/01/understanding-using-rest-api/)
