Amazon Top 50 Bestselling Books 2009 - 2019 API.

https://www.kaggle.com/sootersaalu/amazon-top-50-bestselling-books-2009-2019/version/1

## Features

- Endpoint documentation
- Endpoints using params and query
- Empty endpoint for future use

## Production Process

I started by choosing a database on Kaggle to create the API. After analysing the response, I planned and structured possible endpoints and their structure.

Both query and params were used to filter through the data for the different endpoints.

I used map to create an index info, so I could search for a specific id.
