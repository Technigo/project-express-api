# Project Express API

This project is a RESTful API built with Express.js, designed to manage and provide event data. The API allows users to fetch, filter, and explore events based on categories, cities, and prices. It is hosted on Render and connected to a React-based frontend project for a seamless user experience.

To approach the task, I started by planning a clear structure for the data and identifying the necessary endpoints to ensure smooth functionality for the frontend. I used Express.js to build the server and added flexible filtering logic, enabling multiple search criteria to work simultaneously. The API also includes basic error handling to manage invalid requests effectively.

It was a fun challenge to connect the backend and frontend projects!
