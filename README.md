# Project Express API

Project to develop an Express API that provides data from a JSON file with RESTful endpoints. This API is designed to handle multiple requests, offering filtered collections and specific individual items based on the user's needs.

## The problem

It was my first backend project and challenging in a way that there are many new terms and concepts. Understanding REST principles and working with query parameters to retrieve data accurately was confusing.
