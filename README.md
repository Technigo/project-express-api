# Project Express API
The goal of this project was to create an API using Express that has a couple of RESTful endpoints which return either an array of data, or a single item.

## The problem

This project doesn't include databases, so I used a hard-coded set of data about avocados stored as a JSON file. This API only performs GET requests and is built using Express.
