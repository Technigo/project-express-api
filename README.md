# Express API Project

This API have five paths so far. 
#1 // Endpoint with the entire data. A collection (array) of elements. 
#2 // Endpoint finding a single (by id) production on Netflix
#3 // Endpoint presenting an alfabetic order of directors and then filter to avoid empty values.  
#4 // Endpoint filter on release-year
#5 // Endpoint filter on categories (ex. Movie, TV Shows ... ) + sending Error-message if not found

## The problem
I need more ideas of what to combine in the data. ....Working on that. What is useful is the question? :)  

## View it live
Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
