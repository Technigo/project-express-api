# Express API Project

This week's project we got to start our backend journey by creating an API using Express. Our API should have a couple of RESTful endpoints which return either an array of data or a signle item.

## Tech & Tools

## View it live

Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
