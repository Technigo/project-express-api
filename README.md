# Project Express API

First project to make my own API and explore the surface of backend development.

## The problem

I started with having chat GPT creating a JSON list with data entry for all albums made by the band The Grateful Dead. Next, I created routes with endpoints for showing all albums, for searching for one album using query params, for listing albums by a given id and for album sorted by the year it was released. I used GET method to make the api respond.
