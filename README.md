- Root: /
- Eruptions: /eruptions
- Eruption by id: /eruptions/:id
- Eruption by name: /eruptions/name/:name
- Eruptions by year: /eruptions/year/:year
- Eruptions by region: /eruptions/region/:region
- Eruptions by type: /eruptions/type/:type
- Eruptions by rock type: /eruptions/rock-type/:rockType
- 20 highest volcanoes: /eruptions/elevation/highest-20
- 20 lowest volcanoes: /eruptions/elevation/lowest-20
