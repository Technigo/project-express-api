# Project Express API

This project is a simple backend API built with Express that returns data from a hard-coded JSON file. It includes RESTful endpoints to fetch a collection of items, filter data using query parameters and retrieve individual items by ID.

## The problem

I approached the project by first setting up a basic Express server, using middleware like `cors` for cross-origin access and `nodemon` for development. The data is filtered and manipulated using JavaScript array methods like `.find()` and `.filter()`. The API documentation is dynamically generated with express-list-endpoints.
