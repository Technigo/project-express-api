# Project Express API

First week with backend building a express api.

## The problem

I started created an API using Express.
The API is organized using REST and the data behind the API is 1375 Netflix titles and some data about them. I created different API endpoints to filter, find, limit and order the items returned in the response, which are sent in JSON format.
