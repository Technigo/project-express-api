# Express API Project

Assignment was to create a backend API using Express. Rather than using a database (which we will do next week) the API gets data from a locally stored file. 

## The problem

It was a bit tricky to be creative enough to figure out more endpoints after the initial 2 that was required for the project. In the end I decided to build a simple frontend in Material UI that helped me figure out what endpoints needed from backend.
