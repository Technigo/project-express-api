## 1. What is this?

The purpose of this project was to build an API for a set of data using Node.js - Express framework.

## 2. What did I do?

The API I've built is for a static set of book data.
I've built two different routes. One to show all the books and filter them by queries and another one to show a specific book.
For the first route the results are shown in pages of 10 items.

- Example url for main route: /books?page=0&rating=desc&lang=eng
- Example url for specific book: /book/{id}

## 3. Where can you see it in action?
