# Project Express API

This is my first backend project where I have created an API in Node using Express. The API have RESTful endpoints and I chose to use the API with data from Netflix that was provied in the project file. (The data is stored in a json-file)

## The problem

I created some routes and used methods like filer, map, find to select and display the correct info on each route. Apart from Express I also used Postman to test my routes.

## View it live

Here is a link to the project:
