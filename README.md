# Project Express API

Building API-endpoints in Node using Express. Then deploy to Heroku.

## The problem

JSON files with hard-coded data was already prepared. I used tha data to create different endpoints.
To sort things out I used array methods such as .find() and .filter().
The API was then deployed to Heroku.
