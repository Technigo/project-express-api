# Project Express API

Brief project teaching the basics of using Node.js and Express.

## The problem

I read the instructions and related material, watched some videos on youtube and got started. The plan was to familiarize myself enough that I could get started and then take it from there.
Next steps, which will happen in future projects, would be to connect the backend to a database and also to a frontend.

Tech/frameworks used: Node.js, Express, JavaScript, nodemon
