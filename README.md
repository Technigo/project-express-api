# Project Express API

In our first step into backend, the assigment was to create an API using Express. The API should have at least a couple of RESTful endpoints which return either an array of data or a single item.

## The problem

I created an API about dog breeds using Express.js and Node.js. The main challenge was getting the file paths right and figuring out how to filter the data by categories. I learned a lot about working with JSON data and API endpoints.
If I had more time, I would add more filtering options and create a simple frontend to display the data in a user-friendly way.
