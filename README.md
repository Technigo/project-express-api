# Express API Project
This project's goal is to create my first RESTful API using Node in Express. This API should have a series of endpoints which return an array of data or a single object. I worked with a hardcoded dataset in JSON format with a list of 500 books and their details. I created the different endpoints by manipulating the data with JavaScript methods like: filter(), find() and slice().
