# Express API Project
This is my first project built with Node. The assignment was to build an API using RESTful routes in Express. 
The routes should be able to manipulate the data by selecting, filtering and limiting arrays.

## The problem
I started by choosing one of the provided JSON files to work with, and then started to plan on how I could filter the data using different end points with params and queries. 
Then I started to set up the most basic end points first, and then I did it step by step to the highest level of filtering. Then I set up some error handling messages. 

As the last step I set up a little bit of documentation in the start end point. 

If I had more time my next steps would be to implement a simple frontend to visually display some of the data. I would also try to implement more ways of filtering/selecting data in even more detail.
