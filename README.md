# Express API Project

The project this week was to create RESTful API with several useful endpoints. It was requested to create a minimum of one endpoint displaying a single item, and one endpoint presenting an array of items. 

## The problem

I started with creating my own dataset collecting all books written by the Swedish / Norwegian author Margit Sandemo. I then created several endpoints displaying all books, one specific book selected by either id or title, several books based on which series they belong to etc. I also made it possible to filter by using query parameter, to find books where a specified character is included. 

I also made sure to included error messages to display in case there is no result to be found. 

When I had set up all the information in the dataset, and created all the endpoints, I also created a front-end where I presented the information from the dataset, and also published my API documentation. I created the front-end using React and React router.
