# Project Express API

The task was to build an own API using Express.js and data from a json-file.

## The problem

Since I'm not used to working backend it felt a bit unusual to not be able to see the changes directly, so I was first not sure if I was completely wrong. But I think it turned out good, and I even used a different json-file than the one provided. The one I used was a database over strength exercises, which is my biggest interest and simply funnier to work with.

## View it live

Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
