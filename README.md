# Project 17 Express API Project build on Technigo Bootcamp spring 2020

In this project I have built my very first own API, and the main goal was to creade a data file and then to create different RESTful endpoints which either retrievs an array of data or a single item. 

## The problem

I started this project by chosing which data to show and use for my API. 
I chose to use two different sources to see if you could use that for your API, and it worked. In all fetches I used the HTTP verb GET method, since I did not update the data in any way, I just wanted to present it. If I would have more time, I definetly would experiment a bit more with the endpoints and use other verbs and other methods for filtering the outcome.
