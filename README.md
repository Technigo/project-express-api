# Project Express API

This is a RESTful API for fetching data from a collection of books in JSON format. It allows users to filter, sort, and retrieve books based on various criteria.

## The problem

I started out by fetching the whole list of books and then proceeded with fetching more and more specific parts of the data. After having fetched all the aquired data, I started combining and rewriting different get-request to avoid to much repetition in the code.
