# Express API Project
This is my first project built with **Node.js**. The assignment was to build an **API using RESTful routes in Express**. 
The routes should be able to manipulate the data by selecting, filtering and limiting arrays.

## The problem
I started by choosing one of the provided JSON files to work with, and then started to plan on how I could filter the data using different endpoints with params and queries. 
Then I started to set up the most basic endpoints first, and then I did it step by step to the highest level of filtering. Then I set up some error handling messages. I used **Postman** to test the API.

As the last step I set up some documentation in the start endpoint using the npm package **express-list-endpoints**. 

If I had more time my next steps would be to implement a simple frontend to visually display some of the data. I would also try to implement more ways of filtering/selecting data in even more detail. I would also implement pages using .slice()-method to return only a selection of results from the array and then add a query parameter to allow the user to ask for the next page.
