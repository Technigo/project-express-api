# Express API Project

This API have five paths so far. 
#1 // Endpoint with the entire data. A collection (array) of elements. 
https://moa-netflix-deployment.herokuapp.com/productions
#2 // Endpoint finding a single (by id) production on Netflix 
https://moa-netflix-deployment.herokuapp.com/productions/81193313  <- 81193313 = example id.
#3 // Endpoint presenting an alfabetic order of directors and then filter to avoid empty values.
https://moa-netflix-deployment.herokuapp.com/directors 
#4 // Endpoint filter on release-year
https://moa-netflix-deployment.herokuapp.com/release/2002  <- 2002 = example year.
#5 // Endpoint filter on categories (ex. Movie, TV Shows ... ) + sending Error-message if not found
https://moa-netflix-deployment.herokuapp.com/content/Movie  <-- Movie = example category

## The problem
I need more ideas of what to combine in the data. ....Working on that. What is useful is the question? :)
