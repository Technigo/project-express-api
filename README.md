# Express API Project

This is my first API. I used an already created json file which includes top songs.

## The problem

I think it was pretty straight forward how to create the different endpoints. So I just created some easy and tried out one with a smaller then argument, just to see how it worked. 

The rest of the time I tried to reached the API from another repository which I couldnt get to work, so if I had more time I would fix that so that I could add a frontend.
