# Project Express API

This Express API project provides a set of endpoints to interact with a book database. It includes endpoints to retrieve all books, a specific book by its id, books by language, all languages, books by author, all authors, and books by ratings.

## The problem

The initial challenge in this project was setting up the correct routing and handling requests and responses in Express. Additionally, handling special characters in author names for the author-specific endpoint required careful implementation.
