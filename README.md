# Project Express API

The aim for this week's project is to start learning the basic of backend. Main focus is building our own API. I created my own Ramen API (aside from what Technigo suggested). Then I created several endpoints that return single result and array of elements.

## The problem

Surprisingly, this first step on backend programming was pretty smooth and I had lots of good time searching for ideas of which API I want to use. I decided to search for database on kaggle.com and then convert the csv file into json file via csvjson.com. I mostly used the knowledge I got from codealong with both Damien and Daniel to make all this API works.
