# Project Express API

Week 17th project. Build an API with Express.js. And deploy on Render (first time). 

Using REST (Http method + path) and the results displayed must be: an array, a single register, or a failure (incomplete data). 

## The problem

It was my first time on back end and I feel very confortable on that side (server, etc). If I will have more time I would like to style and create a page to show the results properly, but the final project is close!
