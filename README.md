# Project Express API

In this project I created a RESTful API using Express. 

## The problem

I started by creating different route paths for the API which were returning both single items and objects. I used filter() and find() methods to execute this.
I then also added query paths to filter the data in different ways. I used the starting page of the app to list the different paths and their descriptions.
With more time I would like to add sorting and pagination to my app.
