# Project Express API

I have implemented a RESTful API using Node.js, Express.js, and various other middleware packages such as body-parser, cors, express-list-endpoints, swagger-ui-express, and swagger-jsdoc. The API exposes a list of wine reviews that can be queried and filtered by various parameters such as country, variety, price, and points. I have also implemented pagination and sorting of the wine data based on points. Additionally, I have provided an endpoint for retrieving the list of available endpoints of my API using express-list-endpoints.
