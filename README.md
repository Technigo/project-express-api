# Express API Project

The assignment was to create my first API.

## The problem

I chose the golden globes data and created endpoints for the entire collection, params for filtering by year, queries for searching by a specific title. 

I saw this project mostly as an oppurtunity to practice setting up an API. 

If I would have had more time I would have liked to create much more endpoints, queries and a front-end and also implemented a real database.
