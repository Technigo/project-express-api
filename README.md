# Express API Project

Firts node.js project assigment from Technigo 
Create my own API


## The problem

Its a lot of new things to learn and I find it difficult. 
Got some help from former students and re watching the lectures.

Got stuck trying to make a query for the "title", cant make it work. I commented out the code but will return to have an other look when I have more time.
