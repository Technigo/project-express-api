# Project Express API

For this project I created a RESTful API using Express in Node.js. It serves endpoints to retrieve information about different topics and their subtopics from a JSON file. The API allows clients to fetch all topics, topic names, specific topics by name ecc

IÂ´ve added a list of enpoints below ðŸ‘‡

# Setting up project

npm init
npm install nodemon @babel/core @babel/preset -env @babel/node

# Endpoints

- /topics
- /topics/name
- /topics/:name
- /topics/:name/subtopics
