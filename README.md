# Express API Project

The assignment was to create an RESTful API using Express.

## The problem

To solve the problem I created the following API endpoints:
- GET /top-music that returns an array of 50 tracks.
- GET /top-music/:id that returns a single track requested by its id.
- GET /genre that returns an array of unique genres in the dataset.
- GET /tracks that is able to return an array of tracks filtered by requested artist or track.

If I hade more time I would have tried to build a frontend that could display the data to the user.
