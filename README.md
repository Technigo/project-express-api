# Express API Project

This project is about working with backend and creating an API.

## The problem

To create this API I had to work with NodeJs and express. I learned how to create API endpoints and how to return proper responses. When I got stucked with ideas or soultions I used Google and StackOverflow.

##  Endpoints:
- Root: `/`
- books (shows the books Library): `/books` 
- title: `/books?title=(book title)`
- author: `/books?author=(book author)`
- books by ID: `/books/id`
