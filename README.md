# Express API



## View it live



## What I got to learn ðŸ§ 

* How to build an API in Node using Express
* How to install and setup an Express server
* How to create routes in Express
* Practice data manipulation in JavaScript - selecting, filtering, and limiting arrays
* How to deploy Node projects

## Requirements reached ðŸ§ª

* The api has a couple of RESTful endpoints which return either an array of data, or a single item
* The API have at least 2 routes - with a minimum of one to return a collection of results, and one to return a single result
* The API is deployed to Heroku
* The API is RESTful

## Strech goals reached ðŸ§˜

* Accept filters via query parameters to filter the data you return from endpoints which return an array of data.
* If your dataset is large, try implementing 'pages' using `.slice()` to return only a selection of results from the array. You could then use a query parameter to allow the client to ask for the next 'page'.
* On routes which return a single item, handle when the item doesn't exist and return some useful data in the response.
