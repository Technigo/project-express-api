# Express API Project

This is a book API built in Node using Express.

## The problem

The task was to create an API with two endpoints. I used .filter() to be able to filter all the books by a certain author or by title with queries and .find() to make the id endpoint to be able to find a single books. If I had more time I would like to make more queries and pagination.
