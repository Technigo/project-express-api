# Express API Project

Replace this readme with your own information about your project. 

Create a backend server using express which had various several endpoints for returning data, using queries
to refine our results. 

## The problem


I used various queries to allow the user to refine the data returned, including searching based on a keyword
and then order results by different fields. After I deployed my backend to heroku I created a React project
to fetch from my backend end points to create a Goodreads like database where the user could also upload
cover images for the books (as there were no image urls provided in the API), add their own rating to the existing
ratings and add new books to the data base. 

If I had more time I would have expanded the functionality to perhaps allow the user to write their own description
of the book, as well as tweaking the rating function so that the user could change their rating without it distorting
the results by creating a whole new rating.
