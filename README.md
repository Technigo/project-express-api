# Express API Project
This week was the first week with backend and the brief was to create our own API using Express, with RESTful endpoints. 

We learned: 
– How to install and setup an Express server.
– How to create your first routes.
– How to deploy Node projects.

## The problem

I found this week a bit tricky of knowing what data to choose, therfor I only come up with 4 endpoints. But I will work on some more when I've sorted my mind. 

## View it live

#1 https://caroline-books-deployment.herokuapp.com/books (All the data from the API)
#2 https://caroline-books-deployment.herokuapp.com/books/authors (Data that shows all the authors)
#3 https://caroline-books-deployment.herokuapp.com/books/id/1 (Data filtered by id. 1 is an example.)
#4 https://caroline-books-deployment.herokuapp.com/books/pages/245 (Data filtered by number of pages. 245 is an example.)
