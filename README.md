# Express API Project

The goal of this project was to build an API using Express.

## The problem

I started by thinking about which endpoints would be useful from the user's perspective and how to name them with that in mind. Then I added some search queries for the different endpoints.

## View it live

Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
