# Project Express API

This project involves building a RESTful API using Node.js and Express to manage and display information about board games. The goal is to implement multiple endpoints that meet specific requirements:

Documentation at the root (/) endpoint: The API should include a root endpoint providing documentation about all available endpoints and their functionalities.

Data management endpoints: At least three endpoints should be implemented to handle and return:

A collection of results (e.g., an array of board games).

A single result (e.g., a specific board game based on a unique identifier).

RESTful structure: The API must follow REST principles and adhere to clean coding guidelines.
