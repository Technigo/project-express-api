# Express API Project

This was a week 17 project @Technigo and an introduction to Express, creating Express routes and building an API in NOde using Express. It was also a practice in JavaScript data manipulation.

## The problem

I started by selecting the API I would be working with and studying it in Postman. After that I started to plan what endpoints to create (some with path params and some with query params) and started building them. Since the API was returning +500 results I also looked into pagination and how to implement it. I also set a default pagination of 20 objects on /books and /books/rating. On /books/rating the books are sorted according to the rating with a basic sorting. On /books the books are sorted according to the title but uses string sorting.
