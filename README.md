# Project Express API
Creating an express API. This week we installed and set up an Express server using Noce and the Google Cloud Platform  

## The problem
First I downloaded the repo and set up my account on Google cloud platform. I created the server.js using the books.json as my data package. I tested the API in postman and seemed to get all the endpoints i was searching for so I continued to try to created a frontend to better show the data from the API.

API ENDPOINTS
To filter books and show books with ratings higher than 4:
/book-wellrated 

To get all book titles availible with the API:
/book-titles

To get all authors: 
/book-authors

To find a book with a specific title or specific words in the title:
/book-titles/:title
