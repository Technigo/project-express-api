# Express API Project ðŸ¤–

In this project Iâ€™ve made a Golden Globe Awards API using Express! ðŸš„

## The problem
I hade a probelm with an idea with categoriz based on Drama, best Actress etcâ€¦ But it returned an empty array... Looking for solutions on that!

## View it live

ALL ENDPOINTS:

Whole array
https://goldenglobeawards.herokuapp.com/nominations

Choose a specific golden globe year with switching xxxx too a year, for example 2010
https://goldenglobeawards.herokuapp.com/nominations/years/xxxx

This did work but now it doesnâ€™tâ€¦ But the idea was to get categorize based on Drama, best Actress etcâ€¦
