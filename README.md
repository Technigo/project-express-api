# Express API Project

My first API built using Express! You can use the endpoints below to access different data (from netflix):

/titles - Data for all netflix titles included in the json file.

/titles/${id} - Data for a specific title ID from the json file. 

/year/2019 - Data for a specific release year. 

/type/movie - Data for only movies

/type/tvshow - Data for only TV Shows

## Tech learned
