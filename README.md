# Express API Project

Build an RESTful API using Express. Return either an array of data
or a single item.

## Features

RESTful API
Several routes
Endpoints using params and query

## Production Process

I started by looking at different databases to choose one I was inspired by. I used data about popular songs on Spotify. I thought of differend endpoints that could be of use, taking my self as a gym instructor looking for musik as an example.

Both query and params were used to filter through the data for the different endpoints.
This is my first backend project.
