Route params were okay
Query params were harder

Wrote URL examples in comments as they were hard to remember

/books
/books/8 (or any book id number)
/books/title (replace title with the actual title of a book)
/books?author=AuthorName (replace AuthorName with the actual author name)
/books/top?count=5 (or any amount of top books you would like to see, 5 is default)
