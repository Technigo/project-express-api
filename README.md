# Project Express API
In this week's project, I built my first api using nodeJS with the Express framework. 

Viewers should be able to see the semantic endpoints and filter specific data. 



**/books** is the base endpoint. Users can get all the books that exist in the provided data.

**/books/top-rated** will bring users to all books whose average rating is higher than 4

**/books/title/:title** will bring users to a specific book with a specific title. 

**/books/authors/:authors** will bring users to all books from a specific author.
