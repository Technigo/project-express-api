# Project Express API

This project was an backend project were I created an API using Express. The API is organized using REST and the data behind the API is 1375 Netflix titles and some data about them. I created different API endpoints to filter, find, limit and order the items returned in the response, which are sent in JSON format.

## The problem

This project doesn't include databases, so I used a hard-coded set of data about netflix titels stored as a JSON
file. This API only performs GET requests and is built using Express.
