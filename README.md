# Express API Project

Learning backend by creating an API using Express that use RESTFUL endpoints.

## The problem

I created the basic endpoints for returning all the data first and then started to create more specific queries to filter the data. I want to understand how to use .sort so I can alphabetically sort the data rather  than having it appear randomized. I also ran into issues with my ports being used and my ubuntu linux not working properly. But after going through stackoverflow and chatting with a dev mentor I was able to resolve my issues by killing the node process's running and allocating more space and memory to my virtualbox machine.
