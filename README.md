# Project Express API

This is the first backend project I've ever built! The focus was on how to build an API with a few RESTful endpoints.

## The problem

Since we're not using databases yet I used a hard-coded set of data that I found on Kaggle, that I stored as a JSON-file. The data presents the top 100 trending books on Amazon right now. It was fun going back to somewhat "basic" vanilla-JS, using all the array methods such as .find(), .filter() and .slice() to make the different endpoints. I've been practising on how to use RESTful routing and I went back on forth between what would be the most logic way to formulate the endpoints.
