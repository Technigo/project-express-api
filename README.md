# Express API Project üöÜ

>For this project, I have used my own API built from my own STEAM games library. I did this by connecting my STEAM account to [Rawg.io](https://rawg.io/) and then extracted the data in a .json format to build my very first server using Node.js and Express.

üí´ Endpoints:

- Root: `/`
- Games: `/games` (shows the Game Library)
- Favorites: `/games/favorites`
- Specific game: `/games/(game name)`
