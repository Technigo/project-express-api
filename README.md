# Project Express API

I have built my first API. I used a dataset with information on avocado sales from 2015 in US.  

## The problem

- Installed and set up an Express server
- Built a RESTful API in Node using Express
- Deployed my Node project on google cloud
- Kept on practising data manipulation in JavaScript - selecting, filtering and limitin arrays (had use of some of the code katas we been through)

Would like to give it a frontend but I guess that is for next project ;) 

## View it live
