## Project 15: Express API Project

Created my first API using Express

## The process

- I got familiar with the data I was going to work with
- Thought about some endpoint that would make sense
- Created endpoint returning multiple and single results

## Focus
- How to build an API in Node using Express
- How to create routes in Express
- Practice data manipulation in JavaScript - selecting, filtering arrays and using methods like map, find etc.

## Challenges to solve

Add more endpoints and connect the API to Frontend
