# Project Express API

This is the first Backend Week and we are building our first API with Express.js.

## The problem

I started by installing all dependencies and the doing the basic routes in server.js. Additionally I wanted to add a query route wich I did for searching the book titles.
If I would have more time I would build the frontend.
