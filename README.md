# Express API Project - my first backend project.

I built and an API using Express with a couple of RESTful endpoints which return an array of data and single items.

## The problem by making an endpoint find a single item
Found out I needed to use "let" instead of "const" to be able to make the single query work

## View it live here :

When it runs in VS Code I can see these arrays: 
http://localhost:8080/artists 
http://localhost:8080/tracks 
http://localhost:8080/genres
