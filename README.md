# Project Express API

This weeks assignment was to make an API with at least 2 routes. A minimum of one endpoint to return a collection of results (array of elements). A minimum of one endpoint to return a single result (single element).

## The problem

I was sick most of this week so this project has no frontend. If I had more time, I would add that.

## The endpoints
 /: "Hello avocados!" message
/avocadosales - all the data (example: /avocadosales)
/avocadosales/regions - list of unique regions from the sales data (example: /regions)
/avocadosales/regions/{region} - list of sales for specific regions (example: /regions?region=Albany)
/avocadosales/:month  - avocado sales data for a specific month (example: /months/10)
/avocadosales/:id - avocado sales data for a specific id (example: /avocados/5)
