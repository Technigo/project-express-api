# Project Express API
This week's project is to start your backend journey by creating an API using Express. Your API should have at least a couple of RESTful endpoints which return either an array of data or a single item.

**What you need to do**
✓ Your API should have at least 2 routes.
✓ A minimum of one endpoint to return a collection of results (array of elements).
✓ A minimum of one endpoint to return a single result (single element).
✓ Your API should be RESTful

## The problem
I started going through the videos for this week and then coded along to the live session recording that got me started on the project. If I had more time I would create some frontend as well.
