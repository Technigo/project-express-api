# My first API Backend/Frontend
 This is the backend I built for the project express API repository.


## The problem - How I solved it

This week it was all about 

- How to install and setup an Express server.
- How to create my first routes.
- How to deploy Node projects.
- Practicing data manipulation in JavaScript - selecting, filtering, and limiting arrays
