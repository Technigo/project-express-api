# Express API Project

This week's project was to create an API using Express. 
The API has RESTful endpoints which return both array of data and single item.

## The problem

I started by looking att the different data files to choose which one was the most interesting for me. 
I am a music lover so i decided to go with the top music data. 

I looked at the data to see what kind of data possible users would like to display when using the API. 
I went for both a query and param approach. For the query part i choose to add array method filter to filter out different artist, song titles, music genres and popularity. Since you can get multiple data for these queries i decided to not use a specific endpoint for this.

I also added an endpoint for a single id and decided to choose the find method for this. 

If i would have more time I would try to add the slice method to only show the data that i wanted from each object. I would also try to connect my backend to frontend.
