# Express API Project

The project was to create an API using Express. The API should have a couple of RESTful endpoints which return either an array of data, or a single item.

## The problem

This week's challenge was not so much in the build as in the why and what of each endpoint and query string. I struggled a lot with understanding why an endpoint consisting of a top list based on the data at hand was not a good idea. When I finally had my aha-moment the rest more or less took care of itself. I'm looking forward to exploring the issue with appropriate data further.
