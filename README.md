# Project Express API

This is a RESTful API built with Express.js for managing accommodations data.

## The problem

Built an application integrating a RESTful API backend developed with Express.js and Node.js. Implemented GET, POST, and PUT methods for data manipulation. The frontend, designed with styled-components, utilizes useContext for state management. This solution connects the backend and frontend.If I had more time, I'd test all endpoints in my app(and add more in the backend), add more features, and switch from hardcoded data to using a database.
