# Project Express API

This is a project where I created an API using Express.js!
There are a few paths sorting the data, and also paths defined by query params to sort through the array. I also made a frontend to test it out! This is a link to the deployed frontend page: express-api-frontend-vera.netlify.app

## The problem

This project was pretty straight forward. It was interesting getting a deeper understanding of how API's are built and how to construct systems that go from backend to frontend!
