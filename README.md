# Project Express API - https://project-express-api-5g4lrfrwlq-lz.a.run.app/

## 🏁 Goals:
This week's project is to start your backend journey by creating an API using Express. Your API should have at least a couple of RESTful endpoints which return either an array of data or a single item.

**Must-have requirements**:<br>
✅ Your API should have at least 2 routes. Try to push yourself to do more, though!<br>
✅ A minimum of one endpoint to return a **collection** of results (array of elements).<br>
✅ A minimum of one endpoint to return a **single** result (single element).<br>
✅ Your API should be RESTful.

## 🚧 The problem:

The biggest problem I had was to choose what data to use.
I did experiment both with data sets from Kaggle and local JSON-data.
If I hade more time I would build a cool frontend to this backend.

## 💻 Tech stack:
