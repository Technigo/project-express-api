# Project Express API
### Week 13 Technigo Bootcamp
Creating an express API. This week we installed and set up an Express server using Node and the Google Cloud Platform.  

## The problem
First I downloaded the repo and set up my account on Google cloud platform. I created the server.js using the books.json as my data package. I tested the API in postman and seemed to get all the endpoints i was searching for so I continued to try to created a frontend to better show the data from the API.I managed to show the books with the react carousel and just added in the other endpoints as hyperlinks. 

API ENDPOINTS
To filter books and show books with ratings higher than 4:
/book-wellrated 

To get all book titles availible with the API:
/book-titles

To get all authors: 
/book-authors

To find a book with a specific title or specific words in the title:
/book-titles/:title
