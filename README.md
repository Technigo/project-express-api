# Express API Project

For this project I chose to make my own data set using Kaggle and CSVJSON. The program is showing all living dogs in Zurich, Switzerland. With methods such as slice, filter, find the result is filtered depending on which routes are added in the request.

## The problem

Using params I have several different routes. These uses params so that the user can filter the result depending on for example dog breed, birth year etc. The filtering is done with mehtods such as filter and find. I would've liked to move on to building and connecting a frontend part to the project.
