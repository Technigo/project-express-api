# Project Express API

Open RESTful API with a couple endpoints and queries. The data consists of 450 books.

Routes:
/books, /books/:id, /ratings/:rating.

Queries: /books?author=string, /books?title=string,

## The problem

The problem for me for this project was mainly the abstract nature of APIs but I think it went well for being the first time writing backend code of this nature. The other most problematic this was installing the heroku cli and getting it to connect to my already existing repo. I think the instructions for that were a little lacking and and it ended with me having to go a little off script to get it to work.
