# Express API Project

This project was an introduction to backend and was about creating our own APIs using Express.

## The problem

I chose data already given about Netfllix movies and TV-shows. Then I started with the routes and naming the data as a pluralized route, titles in this case. Then I added different endpoints such as id, year where I used path parameters and then I used query parameter for searching based on whether it is a movie or a TV-show. Filter method was used to get a collection of data based on year and type and find method was used to get a specific TV show/movie based on its unique ID. If I had more time I would have added more endpoints and sorted on more criteria and would have tried to add frontend as well. Express, Node.js, Babel dependencies were used in this project.

## Endpoints

• Root: /
• titles: /titles (This gives data about all the TV-shows and movies of Netflix)
• type: /titles?=type=(Choose Movie or TV Show as the type to get only data      about all the movies or all the TV Shows) 
• year: titles/year (Choose year to only get movies/TV Shows for a specific year)
