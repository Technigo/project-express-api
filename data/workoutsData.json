It is usually performed for higher rep sets, such as 8-12 reps per set or more, in combination with other curls or arm training. It is most similar in arm positioning to a preacher curl, but has some unique benefits to the lower body, as well.",

It can also be performed by sticking a barbell in the corner of a room, preferably in a towel to protect the walls. The linear jammer involves pressing the weight into the air, then catching it with the other hand. The movement focuses primarily on the muscles of the shoulders or deltoids. It can be trained in traditional muscle and strength-focused rep ranges, for lower reps with a focus on explosive pressing power, or for higher reps.",
