Build an API using Express

https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps/pw-c19-api/deploy/github

Since we're not using databases yet, you'll need to use a hard-coded set of data, stored as a JSON file in your project. The API endpoints you create will use this file along with array methods such as to select, filter, or limit the items returned in your responses.

It's up to you to decide what sort of data you'd like to return from your API endpoints.

If you'd like to build your own data set - feel free! You could write it yourself,

## How to get started 💪🏼
3. Open up VS Code and start coding!
4. Install dependencies: `npm install`
5. Start the development server: `npm run dev`

## Example routes 🧭
RESTful routing can take a little time to get used to. Try to think of what the plural term for your data is and use that as a starting point. For example, if you're building an API using the Spotify data in the repo, each item in the data is a track - or song. So a pluralized route for this would be `/songs`. Your routes could then look like this:

`/songs` - Returns an array of songs

`/songs/5` - Returns a single song whose ID is '5'

## How to hand in the code 🎯
- Navigate to your repo and create a Pull Request into the Technigo repo
- Your API should be deployed to Heroku or similar hosting service.
